    "bio": "Hi there! I am Satya! I've been coding for over 6 months now. As a Full Stack developer I've worked both with co-learners and peers to help build & scale our projects and personal projects. Along the journey I realised my passion existed in building advanced, scalable and community serving tools and websites. With this passion, I have now created several projects through Masai school and a few on my own. Through live coaching sessions and Youtube, and had accumulated skills in a range of cool builds and challenges. I am looking forward to deliver REAL VALUE by building REAL WORLD projects to help community and companies thrive in the world of web development. I am slo looking forward to get hands-on experience and learn the skills that are required to succeed in the real-world in this community.",
